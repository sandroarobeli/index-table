# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Design and styling using [Material UI v5](https://mui.com).

## Brief Description

Current application displays S&P 500 index historical returns between 1970 and 2021.
Returns are displaied in two columns: total return for a given year and cumulative return up to 
and including that year. For total returns culumn, positive returns are colored in green and negative 
returns in red. These are measured percentage returns and are displayed and formatted as such.
The application features a customized range slider component. The component enables the user to adjust 
the range of years of interest. As the range changes, cumulative return column gets recalculated to 
reflect the new range.
The application is available in two theme versions for comfortable viewing experience. The user can switch between 
light and dark themes at will by pressing the responsive icon button. The icon button changes depending on currenly 
active theme to suggest the alternative.
The application has been designed to be responsive to different device/viewport sizes.
